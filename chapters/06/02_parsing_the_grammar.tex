\section{Parsing the grammar}

First stage of the import process is parsing the grammar file. The parser must be able to read any grammar file and extract the structure information. As stated in the chapter defending the grammar notation selection (chapter  \ref{chap:source_grammar_notation}), there exists an ANTLRv4 grammar for the ANTLRv4 notation\footnote{https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/antlr4}. This means that we can use the ANTLR library\footnote{http://antlr.org/} to generate an ANTLR parser of the ANTLRv4 notation.
