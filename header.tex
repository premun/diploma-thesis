\def\Abstract{%
JetBrains MPS is a language workbench focusing on domain-specific languages.
Unlike many other language workbenches and IDEs, it uses a projectional editor for code.
The developer directly manipulates the program in its tree form (AST) and not by editing a text source code.
This brings many advantages, but on the other hand requires time-consuming and complicated MPS language definition.
The thesis elaborates on the possibility of automating the process of creating MPS language definition from its grammar description.
It introduces the MPS editor, evaluates approaches of related projects and describes author's efforts to implement an MPS plugin that allows this import.
The chosen approach and the selection of tools used for implementation are justified in the thesis.
We point out important problems that any similar project might deal with and we introduce some possible solutions.
Furthermore, the thesis contains examples of imported languages, showing the potency of the chosen approach.
The thesis also aims to lay groundwork for future extensions and suggest possible improvements.
