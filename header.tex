\def\Abstract{%
JetBrains MPS is a language workbench focusing on domain-specific languages. Unlike many competing language workbenches and in contrast to other editors, it uses a projectional editor for code.
The developer directly manipulates the program in its tree form (AST), not by editing a text source code.
This requires quite time-consuming and complicated MPS language definition.
The thesis elaborates on the possibility of automating the process of creating MPS language definition from an existing language grammar.
It introduces the MPS editor and the given problem and evaluates approaches of related projects.
Then, it describes author's efforts to implement an MPS plugin, that allows this import.
It justifies the chosen approach and the selection of tools used for implementation.
We point out important problems, that any similar project might deal with and we introduce some possible solutions.
Furthermore, the work contains examples of imported languages, showing the potency of the chosen approach.
The thesis aims to lay the groundwork for future follow-ups and suggest possible improvements.
